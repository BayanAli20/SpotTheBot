Welcome to the GitHub repository for the project accompanying the paper "Comparative Study of Natural Languages as Self-Organised Critical Systems". This project explores the properties of natural languages through the lens of self-organised criticality, employing K-means and Wishart clustering techniques for analysis.

Introduction
This project aims to examine natural languages as self-organised critical systems. By applying clustering methods such as K-means and Wishart clustering, we aim to uncover patterns and structures that provide insights into the self-organising properties of natural languages.
